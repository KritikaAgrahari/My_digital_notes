Resolving merge conflicts typically involves using version control systems like Git, and it’s not directly related to an IDE like Dev-C++ or the command window itself. However, you can use Git commands from the command line to resolve merge conflicts. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve merge conflicts using Git in the command window:

### Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts Using Git

1. **Check the Status**:
   - Open the command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run:
     ```shell
     git status
     ```
   - This will show you which files have conflicts.

2. **Open the Conflicted Files**:
   - Use a text editor to open the files listed in the status. You can use `notepad`, `vim`, `nano`, or any text editor of your choice:
     ```shell
     notepad path/to/conflicted-file
     ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Look for conflict markers in the file. They look like this:
     ```
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     // Your code
     =======
     // Incoming changes
     >>>>>>> branch-name
     ```
   - Edit the file to resolve the conflicts by keeping the desired changes and removing the conflict markers.

4. **Mark the Conflicts as Resolved**:
   - After resolving the conflicts, save the file.
   - Add the resolved files to the staging area:
     ```shell
     git add path/to/resolved-file
     ```

5. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Commit the resolved changes:
     ```shell
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```

6. **Continue with the Merge (if applicable)**:
   - If you were in the middle of a merge, Git might automatically complete the merge after the commit. If not, you can complete the merge process.

### Alternative: Using a Merge Tool

You can also use merge tools to help visualize and resolve conflicts. Popular merge tools include:

- **KDiff3**
- **Meld**
- **Beyond Compare**

To use a merge tool, you might need to configure it in Git and then invoke it:

```shell
git mergetool
```

This command opens the merge tool to help you resolve conflicts interactively.

### In Dev-C++

If you prefer using Dev-C++ and it supports Git integration, you might find options to resolve conflicts directly in the IDE. Check the documentation or settings within Dev-C++ for Git support.

If Dev-C++ doesn't support Git natively, using the command window or an external Git GUI tool is the way to go.
